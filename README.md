# Bash-Scripting
## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a bash script that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. For this project I used loops, user input and conditional logic.
## Project Description
I wrote a bash script that will prompt a user to enter a number and ask if they want the full multiploication table from 1 to 10 or a partial table within a specified range. Based on the user's response, the script will display the corresponding multiplication table.
## Project Implementation
### User input number: I used the echo keyword to prompt the user to enter a number
