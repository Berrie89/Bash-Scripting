# Bash-Scripting
## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a bash script that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. For this project I used loops, user input and conditional logic.
## Project Description
I wrote a bash script that will prompt a user to enter a number and ask if they want the full multiploication table from 1 to 10 or a partial table within a specified range. If they choose partial, they will be prompted to enter the start and end number. Based on the user's response, the script will display the corresponding multiplication table.
## Project Implementation
User input number: I used the echo keyword to prompt the user to enter a number, then the read command to assign a variable to the information provided by the user.
Conditional logic: I used the if-else statement to ask if the user wants a full or partial table. 
Use of Loop: I used the C-style for loop to implement the logic to generate the multiplication table.
Input Validation: I ensured the users enter valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range. If incorrect range is entered the user receives an error message and default to a full multiplication table.
